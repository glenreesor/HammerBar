## Unreleased

#### Added

- The window button of the currently active window now has a blue bar under it
- `AppLauncher`:

  - Configuration has changed from a single string specifying the bundleID to
    an object with a `bundleId` key:

        local firefoxLauncher = spoon.HammerBar.widgets:appLauncher({
          bundleId = 'org.mozilla.firefox',
        });

  - This new configuration object supports the following optional keys in addition
    to `bundleId`:

    - `hoverLabel` - a label to show when the launcher is hovered
    - `newInstance` - a boolean indicating whether to start a new instance of the program
    - `args` - a table listing commandline arguments to pass to the program

    For example, to start Firefox using a different profile and include a hover
    label to distinguish that profile:

          local firefoxLauncher = spoon.HammerBar.widgets:appLauncher({
            bundleId = 'org.mozilla.firefox',
            hoverLabel = 'test-profile',
            newInstance - true,
            args = { '-P', 'test-profile' },
          });

- `AppMenu`:

  - Similar to `AppLauncher`, each app entry can optionally include a list of
    command line arguments and `newInstance` (there is no `hoverLabel`):

        local appMenu = spoon.HammerBar.widgets:appMenu({
            appList = {
              { bundleId = 'org.mozilla.firefox', label = 'FF' },
              {
                bundleId = 'org.mozilla.firefox',
                label = 'FF test-profile',
                newInstance = true,
                args = { '-P', 'test-profile' }
              },
              { bundleId = 'com.apple.Safari', label = 'Safari' },
              { bundleId = 'com.apple.finder', label = 'Finder' },
            },
        });

## v1.1.0 (2025-05-02)

#### Enhancements

- `LineGraph` widget expanded view:
  - Current value is right aligned
  - More padding below the 0 line
- Clock locale support:
  - Uses system's locale for formatting the date
  - Config option to specify custom time and or date formats

#### Added

- Hovering over a window button now shows a window preview
  - The pre-release function `setShowWindowPreviewOnHover()` has been removed, so if
    you were using that, it'll need to be removed from your `init.lua`
- New widgets:
  - Clock variants: `analog-clock`, `analog-circles-clock`
  - `cpuMonitor`
  - `lineGraphCurrentValue`
    - Similar to `LineGraph`, but:
      - Shows current value (in white) instead of max value
      - Doesn't show anything on hover, due to the current value always being shown

#### Fixed

- widget popups don't respect screen edges (Fixes https://github.com/glenreesor/HammerBar/issues/9)

## v1.0.2 (2024-10-26)

- No changes from v1.0.2-beta

## v1.0.2-beta (2024-10-08)

#### Fixed

- Missed mouse events when mouse enters or leaves window buttons, resulting in
  missed hovers and slow responses to mouse clicks

## v1.0.1 (2024-09-01)

#### Fixed

- Fixes new windows displayed when bar is hidden (#4)
- Fixes some Adobe Programs not showing up in Hammerbar (#2)
